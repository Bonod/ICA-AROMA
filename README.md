# ICA-AROMA
============
ICA-AROMA (i.e. ‘ICA-based Automatic Removal Of Motion Artifacts’) concerns a data-drive method to identify and remove motion-related independent components from fMRI data. To that end it exploits a small, but robust set of theoretically motivated features, preventing the need for classifier re-training and therefore providing direct and easy applicability. This beta-version package requires installation of Python and FSL. Read the provided 'manual.pdf' for a description on how to run ICA-AROMA.
